# Card Solitaire
I just wanted a solitaire game to play that wasn't doofy. Currently plays as FreeCell.

Not quite finished; the free cells are in the upper left, and the goal stacks
are in the upper right, they just don't have any visual indication yet.

There's no autocompletion, so you need to move each card one at a time.

## Current Features
- Drag and drop cards between stacks, goals, and free cells.
- Card's suit is also displayed next to the value horizontally, so the suit doesn't get covered up.
- Each goal stack's "next" card is highlighted.
